Look, if you aren't one of the two people this is made for, maybe just go

<a href="https://www.howtobeawkward.lol">howtobeawkward.lol</a>
<a href="https://www.thescript.lol">thescript.lol</a>

This is a hobby project made for me and two friends. It's a website located at www.thescript.lol (howtobeawkward.lol is also a valid url that will redirect to it). If you're seeing this and you're confused, this probably isn't made for you. I'm mostly just playing around with making a website as I've never done it from scratch before. Using GitHub Pages for frontend hosting and Firebase for backend. Got my domains from Porkbun. Honestly surprised I'm able to do this for free. (Other than the domains, but I could have done without them and it was $3.52 to get the pair for a year.) 

It probably has a lot of inconsistencies and broken links and is very clearly unfinished; That's because it is. It's unfinished and it will be for a while. Just putting a few hours of work into it here and there. Again, I really recommend clicking off if you somehow stumbled upon this and aren't myself or one of the two people that I made this for.
