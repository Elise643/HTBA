This is a hobby project made for me and two friends. It's a website located at www.thescript.lol made for an entirely fictional school. This is unfinished and is primarily something I'm doing to get a better understanding of the logistics in making a website (in short: to test things out and learn).  I'm using GitHub Pages for frontend hosting and Google's Firebase (Firebase Authenticator and Firestore) for backend. All domains were purchased and set up through PorkBun.

This is entirely recreational and not intended to be professional or taken seriously as an actual site. There's a lot that still needs to be done. 
I could have formatted my code better; I wasn't intending for it to be viewed by anyone other than myself. There are stray comments and commented labels are used very inconsistently. My commit messages appear to be nonsense now that I'm looking over them again; it seems I was writing whatever came to mind as this was not intended to be serious.

All code was done by me.<br>
