  <p>A toss my hood over my head, shadowing my face from the eyes of others. “We have a few new students coming today. First child, enter!” The teacher says from inside the classroom. I walk in quickly, looking at the other students that are seated around me. I instantly take their appearances in and already have opinions on them after thirty seconds. Most of them seem to be dumb, arrogant, or just plain out boring. The typical groups of humans. “Please introduce yourself,” The teacher says to me, I glance at her, positive that she just wants to go home and not be talking to a bunch of adolescents. I can’t blame her. She begins to say my name, stops,  and repeats her order, “Just introduce yourself.”<br>
	I roll my eyes under my hood, so that nobody can see me. Must we pretend to be enjoying each other's presence when everybody knows that everybody hates everyone else? “Just call me Con.” I say, incorrectly assuming that nobody cares about my real name.<br>
	“Is that your name?” Asks the teacher. Is this a part of her job? Or does she actually care? I assume it’s the first.<br>
	“No, just call me it.” I smile slightly under my hood. The point is to get people to like me so that I will have back up in a fight. Also I enjoy playing with people's emotions. Humans are such simple creatures, it’s quite entertaining to watch them break.<br>
	“Er…” The teacher begins, seeming quite flustered. It is so easy to play with their emotions, “Please tell us your actual name.” I like that subtle use of the word “us”. It tempts me to avoid the question further, mostly for my own pleasure.<br>
	I tilt my head as if this is the most confusing question ever and respond with a simple word, “Why?” So simple yet so aggravating.<br>
	“We don’t allow fake names. It has to be a name shortening if you need to.” It takes such self control to not laugh at her grammar.<br>
	I shrug, getting bored, “Okay, your choice. Call me Condoliexinsix.” I shift my eyes away from the teacher, glancing at their other students to see their reactions to my name. They don’t seem to care, and probably don’t.  they probably don’t care. Honestly, who cares about anything?<br>
	Of course there’s always that one person. That idiotic person doesn’t realize I said that just to see their reaction, “Can you say that again?”<br>
	I smile and, since I got the reaction I wanted, I repeat the name, “Condoliexinsix.”<br>
The girl, for it was a girl that asked the question, writes down the long word. I smile as I think how badly spelled it likely is. “Thank you.” She says. For what? Telling you my name? Not that that’s my name.. This girl is no longer amusing and I’m ready to sit down when someone else walks in. She doesn’t say anything and just sits down, I nod in her direction, sadly not getting a reaction, before I do the same.<br>
	Two more girls walk in. THe first is nothing noteworthy. She’s a normal height with long hair and a skinny frame. Probably fast but not too physically strong. The second however, is the complete opposite. She towers over everyone else and has noticeable muscles. THe kind of person that would greatly amuse me to see her defeated in combat. Laying on the ground and groaning in pain. A small smile touches my lips. Then I notice her arm is slightly bent in an odd way and I know it’s broken. The smile fades away as I realize I already missed her defeat. My eyes swivel around the room, unnoticed, as I search for the person that could have done this. They land on a tall boy with brown hair and strong build. It would be quite entertaining to watch the two of them fight, and apparently I missed. I scowl under my cloak.<br>
