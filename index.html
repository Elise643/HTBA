    <h2>Welcome to AT School</h2>
    <p>Hi there! By reasonable logic I assume you're in search of a functional (or semi-functional) website. This, admittedly, is not one of those "functional" websites, but could probably pass as semi-functional. Take a look around! Here's some things that at the very least, sort of work :)</p>
    <div id="homepage-list">
      <div><a href="/staff">Staff</a></div>
      <div><a href="/login">Login</a></div>
      <div><a href="/resources">Resources</a></div>
      <div><a href="/signup">Signup</a></div>
      <div><a href="/profile?user='example'">User Profiles</a></div>
      <div><a href="/ships">Ships</a></div>
      <div><a href="/photoupload">Upload Photos</a></div>
      <div><a href="/allaccounts">Account List</a></div>
      <br>
      <p>Current objectives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mass Photo Upload (I have almost 100 Serina picrews from Alix on my phone and I do not want to manually upload all of them)
        </li>
        <li>
          Rearrange photos on profiles (Not entirely sure about the logistics of this) (Should they have the same order for everyone that the person they're of chooses or can each user give themselves a different order that they view a certain person's pictures in?) (Becca asked for this, I'm just not sure how it should be implemented)
        </li>
      </ul>
